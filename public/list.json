    "description": "A more complex version of Skewb. Similarily to a regular Skewb, it rotates around corners rather than faces as the standard Rubik's cube. It has 3 layers - we could compare regular Skewb to a 2x2 and Master Skewb to 3x3. An extra difficulty level is added, but it is not that difficult to learn if you know normal Skewb.",
